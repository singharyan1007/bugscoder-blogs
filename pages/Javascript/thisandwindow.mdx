#  this keyword

> Whenever a javscript function is run, a global execution context, a window object and a this keyword is created.

`this` keyword refers the current object that is executing the code. this  keyword stores the current execution context. 

## Various ways in which the `this` keyword id used

1. implicit binding
- When a function is called as a method of the object, this keyword refers to the object itself.
```typescript
const person = {
     name: "ram",
    age: 22,
    greet: function(){
        return `Hello ${this.name}, you are ${this.age} years old`
    }
}
console.log(person.greet());
```
2. explicit binding
- When a function is called using call, apply or bind method, this keyword refers to the object passed as the first argument of the call, apply or bind method.
```typescript
function ageVerify(){
    if(this.age> 18){
        console.log("Yes you can drive");
    } else {
        console.log("No you cannot drive");
    }
}
  
const per1 = {age: 21};
const per2 = {age: 16};
ageVerify.call(per1); //this refers to per1
ageVerify.call(per2); //this refers to per2
```
3. Default binding
- By default, this keyword refers to the `window` object.

4. Arrow function binding
- Without the function keyword this is unable to refer to the object in the outer scope. 
- Arrow functions do not have their own this keyword. They use the this keyword of the function they are written in.
```typescript   
const person = {
    name: "ram",
    age: 22,
    greet: function(){
        const innerFunc = () => {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
        innerFunc();
    }
}   
console.log(person.greet());
```
