# let & const

`let` and `const` declarations are hoisted, but not initialized. This means that the variable is not available for use until the code execution reaches the declaration. Accessing the variable before the initialization results in a `ReferenceError`.

```typescript
console.log(number)
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization

let number = 10

console.log(number)
```

Variables declared with `let` or `const` are hoisted **WITHOUT a default initialization**. So accessing them before the line they were declared throws **ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization**.

`const` always need to be initialised.

# Temporal Dead Zone
A variable declared with let, const, or class is said to be in a `temporal dead zone` (TDZ) from the start of the block until code execution reaches the place where the variable is declared and initialized.

While inside the TDZ, the variable has not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a `ReferenceError`. The variable is initialized with a value when execution reaches the place in the code where it was declared. If no initial value was specified with the variable declaration, it will be initialized with a value of `undefined`.

This differs from `var` variables, which will return a value of `undefined` if they are accessed before they are declared. But `let` and `const` variables will throw an error if they are accessed before they are declared.

```typescript
// TDZ starts at beginning of scope
  console.log(bar); // "undefined"
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'foo' before initialization
  var bar = 1;
  let foo = 2; // End of TDZ (for foo)
```
