# What is Javascript and how Javascript works behind the scenes ?

Javascript is a high level, object oriented programming language, which is used to make web pages interactive.
It is a synchronous, single threaded language, which means it can execute one line of code at a time in a sequence.

It functions using something called as Execution stack and Event loop.

## Execution context

When a Javascript engine runs a script, it creates an execution context. This execution context is a wrapper to help manage the code that is running. It has two parts. Memory envirenment and code execution.
