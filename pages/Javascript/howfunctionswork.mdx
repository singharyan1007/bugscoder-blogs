# How functions work in Javascript and Call Stack

```typescript

var x=1;
a();
b();
console.log(x)

function a(){
  var x=10;
  console.log(x);

  }
function b(){
    var x=100;
    console.log(x)
  }
  ```
 *Output*
 ```typescript
 10
 100
 1
 ```

 The reason for this lies in the Execution Context and Hoisting.

 First the variable `x`  is assigned value `undefined`. Then both the functions are put in the Memory component. Now, the Global Execution context is put in the Call Stack. Now `function a()` is executed. The Local Execution Context is created in the code region during execution phase. The local variable `x` is assigned to undefined. During the code execution, the `console.log(x)` prints `10` because it is available in the local memory region. After completion of the function, it is removed from the call stack. 

 >So `console.log(x)` print the value of x ,available locally in the memory component.
