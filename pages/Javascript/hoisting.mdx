# Hoisting


Hoisting means, moving all the variable, function and class declarations to the top of their block scope. 
>>Only the declarations, not the initialisations.

This happens because of the Execution context.
```typescript
var a;
console.log(a)
console.log(getNums)

function getNums(num){
    console.log(num*num);
  }
a=10;
getNums(20);
```
```typescript
Output

undefined
//then the whole function block is printed
//now the function result is printed
```

This happens because in execution context all the declared variables are initially assigned as `undefined`. And the whole function is put in the memory component.
