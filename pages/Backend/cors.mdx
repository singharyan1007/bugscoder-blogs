# Same origin policy and CORS

When we visit a website, the browser will make a request to the server on which the website is hosted. Thw server responds by sending back the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that make up the website. The browser then renders the website and displays it to the user. The HTML file may contain reference to one or more external links.When the browser sees reference(s) to a URL in the source HTML, it issues a request. If the request is issued using the URL that the source HTML was fetched from, then the browser processes the response without any issues. However, if the resource is fetched using a URL that doesn't share the same origin(scheme, host, port) as the source HTML, the browser will have to check the `Access-Control-Allow-origin` response header. If it contains * or the URL of the source HTML, the browser will process the response, otherwise the browser will refuse to process it and throws an error.
